This Arduino project simulates a traffic light and pedestrian crossing system, featuring a pedestrian button to request crossing. The system controls an LED traffic light for cars and a pedestrian light, with specific rules for button interaction. If the pedestrian button is pressed while the traffic light is yellow or red, the button press is ignored. When pressed during a green light, the traffic light transitions to yellow for 2.5 seconds, then red for 7.5 seconds. As soon as the car light turns red, the pedestrian light turns white, allowing 3 seconds for crossing. Afterward, the pedestrian light blinks orange for 2 seconds (with a 0.25-second delay) before turning solid orange. The pedestrian light remains solid orange until the next red light for cars, at which point the pedestrian cycle resets. The system repeats this process, managing the traffic and pedestrian signals based on timing and button inputs.
